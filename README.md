## README

- **How the Data Was Scraped**: Data was gathered from the GitHub API using a Python script named `fetching_code.ipynb`, targeting users in Barcelona with over 100 followers and collecting details about their profiles and repositories.
- **Interesting Insight**: A surprising observation was that repositories *enabling both projects and wikis* had only a moderate correlation, suggesting that developers use these features independently rather than in tandem.
- **Recommendation for Developers**: To increase visibility, *focus on creating well-documented repositories with active wikis*, as repositories with *comprehensive documentation* tend to attract more engagement.
